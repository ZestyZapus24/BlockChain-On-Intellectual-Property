# BlockChain-On-Intellectual-Property
Blockchain primarily protects patents, trademarks, and copyrights by providing secure and immutable timestamping of intellectual property-related information. However, the code for integrating blockchain technology into an HTML-based solution will require back-end development and the use of a blockchain platform's APIs or libraries for proper functionality. Below is a simplified example of how one might incorporate blockchain timestamping into an HTML-based interface using JavaScript and the Ethereum blockchain.
This example uses Ethereum blockchain for timestamping, and the front-end code in HTML and JavaScript interacts with a back-end server that communicates with the Ethereum network. You'll also need to deploy a smart contract on Ethereum to record the timestamps. 
To run this example, we'll need to install Flask and execute the script. It creates a basic blockchain with endpoints for adding data and retrieving the blockchain. This is a minimal example, and a real-world IP protection system would require significant enhancements and security measures.
